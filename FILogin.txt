This test will find Family Share on the simulated device's browser, and log in. After ensuring that the login worked, it will log out and close the browser.

This is a text document because I just want to outline the plan before figuring out how to code it all up. As the test develops, this file will become more detailed and specific.

Step 1: Open device.

Step 2: Open browser.

Step 3: Type in Family Share url.

Step 4: Select login.

Step 5: Enter username and password.

Step 6: Select login.

Step 7: Ensure login occurred.

Step 8: Select logout.
